# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is my solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). This challenge helped me practice building responsive layouts and styling with SCSS-like structure using custom properties and utility classes.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (`:root` variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- CSS Grid for responsiveness
- SCSS-style utility structure (BEM + mixin-friendly architecture)

### What I learned

I focused on keeping the markup clean and semantic, while using a scalable CSS structure with custom properties and BEM naming conventions. I practiced fluid spacing with `rem` units and built a mobile-first layout that adapts using media queries.

### Continued development

In future projects, I’d like to:
- Use `clamp()` for font sizing across breakpoints
- Build out components using a proper SCSS structure with mixins and functions
- Add accessibility improvements like focus outlines and screen reader text
- Experiment with small animations or transitions on load/hover
